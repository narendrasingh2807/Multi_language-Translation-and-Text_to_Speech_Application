# Multi_language-Translation-and-Text_to_Speech_Application
This project is an interactive web application built using Streamlit that enables users to translate text into multiple languages and provides text-to-speech functionality for supported languages. The tool uses a combination of libraries, including mtranslate for language translation and gTTS (Google Text-to-Speech) for audio rendering.
